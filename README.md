# ResepSaji FrontEnd

**ResepSaji FrontEnd** is the frontend component of a web application designed to showcase a variety of home-cooked recipes. This application serves as a user-friendly interface for individuals looking to explore, discover, and enjoy recipes from the comfort of their homes. 

## Key Features
- **User Roles**: The application supports two primary user roles:
  - **Admin**: Administrators have the capability to manage recipes, including adding, editing, and deleting recipes, ensuring the content remains fresh and relevant.
  - **User**: Regular users can browse the extensive collection of home-cooked recipes, save their favorites, and explore new dishes based on various categories.
  
- **Interactive UI**: Built with a focus on user experience, the application features an intuitive layout and seamless navigation, allowing users to find their desired recipes quickly.

- **Responsive Design**: Utilizing [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), the frontend is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on devices of all sizes, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend Framework**: Developed using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing for component-based architecture and efficient rendering.
- **TypeScript**: The project incorporates [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), enhancing JavaScript by adding static type definitions, which helps catch errors early in the development process and improves code quality.
- **Styling**: Styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework that facilitates rapid UI development with minimal custom CSS.
